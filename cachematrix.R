## These functions work together to calculate and cache the inverse of a
## given matrix.

## Creates special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix.
## If the inverse has already been calculated, use the cached version.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
